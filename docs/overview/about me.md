# About me
{: .fw-600 }
{: .no_toc }

With over 16 years of experience, I am an expert in creating structured content using XML frameworks. My core area of specialization is developing technical publications for the aerospace and defense sectors leveraging S1000D architecture.

## Experience

I have extensive know-how of XML schemas, modular data concepts, data module coding, content management systems, and publishing tools based on S1000D standard. I bring expertise in analytical skills for mapping source data input requirements to information outputs through XML authoring.

Additionally, I have rich exposure to handling customer Requests for Change (RFC) and communication across global teams within Common Information Repositories. My background in hardware and software fault diagnostics aids me in creating detailed fault isolation manuals and test procedures for complex electronic systems.

## Main XML experience
I have leveraged XML tools such as Arbortext Editor software over my previous projects. As an XML professional, I adopt a process-oriented approach right from source data analysis through content delivery that confirms with aviation regulatory guidelines.

With my blend of XML structuring proficiency and deep domain knowledge in aerospace documentation, I can add value to technical publications projects using S1000D or adjacent standards involving information modeling. My first-person, hands-on expertise will enable me to produce high-quality documentation output for your aviation/defense programs.

## Focus on writing good documentation

Through self-driven learning, I have equipped myself to create intelligent documentation solutions leveraging interoperable content powered by lightweight markup and static site generators. I can now apply my learnings over JAMstack technologies towards delivering next-gen documentation for Agile software teams.

## Next Steps

As an aerospace technical writer looking to move into IT documentation, I wanted to develop my skills in new technologies used for software and web writing. Rather than simply list these tools on my CV, I challenged myself to create a comprehensive project that highlighted their real-world use.

Although the aviation industry relies heavily on XML and legacy tools, this project exemplifies my ability to adapt to modern technical communication stacks widely used in software/IT sectors. I'm eager to apply these lessons in docs-as-code, lightweight markup, CCMS and automation to enterprise-level documentation initiatives in the computer technology sector.
