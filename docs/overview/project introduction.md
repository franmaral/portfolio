# Project Introduction
{: .fw-600 }
{: .no_toc }

This portfolio website was built using the same frameworks that technical writers in IT companies use every day. I wrote the content in Markdown, structured it using the Jekyll static site generator, managed versions on GitHub for review workflows, and published dynamically updated pages using GitHub Pages.

> Although I have worked on a wide range of technical documentation in a variety of industries, some examples of content from previous projects **cannot be made publicly available** due to corporate intellectual property, non-disclosure agreements, and export control restrictions.

## Introduction

This project involved adapting and designing a custom Jekyll theme leveraging layouts, includes, data files, and Sass stylesheets. I took care to optimize site performance for blazing fast speeds through minification and compression. The tech stack demonstrates my grasp over static site generators to deliver documentation sites including user guides, API docs, and online help systems.

The portfolio showcases my experience in content strategy, information architecture, modular S1000D XML writing, and CCMS tools from the aerospace sector.

## Server and Repository

{: .important }
> This portfolio website is a work in progress. New sections and content samples will be changed or added frequently, based on my ongoing learning.

The repository is available from my GitHub profile [https://github.com/franmaral/portfolio](https://github.com/franmaral/portfolio).

The site should now be running under my GitHub page [https://franmaral.github.io/portfolio](https://franmaral.github.io/portfolio).

## Navigation

This Jekyll-based portfolio site features intuitive navigation for easy access to different content areas. The main sections are accessible via a clean left-hand sidebar menu, which displays the projects. This is maintained throughout all of the inner pages, providing context. On mobile devices, the menu collapses into a responsive burger icon, revealing nested links.

## Next Steps

As next steps, I plan to create more complex Static Site-based documentation projects involving automated builds, version control through Git and GitHub integration, decentralized content contribution workflows, and advanced JavaScript.
