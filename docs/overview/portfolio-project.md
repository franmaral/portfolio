# Project Introduction
{: .fw-600 }
{: .no_toc }

This portfolio website was built using the same frameworks that technical writers in IT companies use every day. I wrote the content in Markdown, structured it using the Jekyll static site generator, managed versions on GitHub for review workflows, and published dynamically updated pages using GitHub Pages.

## Introduction

This project involved adapting and designing a custom Jekyll theme leveraging layouts, includes, data files, and Sass stylesheets. I took care to optimize site performance for blazing fast speeds through minification and compression. The tech stack demonstrates my grasp over static site generators to deliver documentation sites including user guides, API docs, and online help systems.

The portfolio showcases my experience in content strategy, information architecture, modular S1000D XML writing, and CCMS tools from the aerospace sector.

## Motivations

As a technical writer, I wanted to develop my skills in new technologies used for software and web writing. Rather than simply list these tools on my CV, I challenged myself to create a comprehensive project that highlighted their real-world use.

The idea behind this portfolio website was the creation of a real-life writing sample that would showcase my **technical documentation skills**. As a technical writer, I used tools that we use every day. These include Markdown for writing, Jekyll for content modelling, and GitHub for version control.

I wanted to emphasise the **documentation mindset** I brought to the table, rather than approaching this as just another development project. 

I focused on **simplifying complex technical details** into easy to understand language, while carefully organising the information to ensure a seamless user experience.

From structured writing in Markdown to optimised site architecture, this project reflects an end-to-end technical communication perspective rather than just coding skills.

## Technology Involved

More specifically, here is a list of key technologies I used to create this site:

- **Markdown** - For authoring content using simple text-based syntax
- **Jekyll** - Static site generator that builds the overall website structure
- **YAML** - Stores site data like page titles and other metadata
- **Ruby** - The underlying programming language that runs Jekyll
- **HTML** - Markup language for content structure and semantics
- **CSS** - Adds styling and design elements
- **GitHub** - Hosts code, enables version control and review workflow
- **GitHub Pages** - Provides free and fast hosting for the Jekyll site
- **Visual Studio Code** - Text editor used for authoring
- **Trello** - Kanban boards for task management
- **Grammarly** - Checks grammar and readability
- **HTMLProofer** - Validates links and HTML output quality
- **Jekyll Sass Converter** - Allows using Sass syntax for CSS
- **Jekyll Attachments** - Adds file attachment capability
- **Jekyll Compress HTML** - Minifies HTML for faster performance

Among others that may be added based on evolving requirements.

## Navigation

This Jekyll-based portfolio site features intuitive navigation for easy access to different content areas. The main sections are accessible via a clean left-hand sidebar menu, which displays the projects. This is maintained throughout all of the inner pages, providing context. On mobile devices, the menu collapses into a responsive burger icon, revealing nested links.

## Server and Repository

The repository is available from my GitHub profile [https://github.com/franmaral/portfolio](https://github.com/franmaral/portfolio).

The site should now be running under my GitHub page [https://franmaral.github.io/portfolio](https://franmaral.github.io/portfolio).

{: .note }
> This portfolio website is a work in progress. New sections and content samples will be changed or added frequently, based on my ongoing learning.

## What's next

As next steps, I plan to create more complex Static Site-based documentation projects involving automated builds, version control through Git and GitHub integration, decentralized content contribution workflows, and advanced JavaScript.
