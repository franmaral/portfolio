## Portfolio Project

While **aerospace XML documentation** has been my primary focus area, I've recently expanded into IT writing through self-initiated projects around software systems and web applications. 

I'm passionate about leveraging lightweight markup including Markdown, HTML, CSS in static pages to make content reusable, portable and future-ready. Through my writing portfolio and client reviews, you'll discover how I simplify the complex without losing technical depth.

## Motivations

The idea behind this portfolio website was the creation of a real-life writing sample that would showcase my **technical documentation skills**. As a technical writer, I used tools that we use every day. These include Markdown for writing, Jekyll for content modelling, and GitHub for version control.  

I wanted to emphasise the **documentation mindset** I brought to the table, rather than approaching this as just another development project. 

I focused on **simplifying complex technical details** into easy to understand language, while carefully organising the information to ensure a seamless user experience. 

From structured writing in Markdown to optimised site architecture, this project reflects an end-to-end technical communication perspective rather than just coding skills.

## Technology Involved

More specifically, here is a list of key technologies I used to create this site:

- **Markdown** - For authoring content using simple text-based syntax
- **Jekyll** - Static site generator that builds the overall website structure
- **YAML** - Stores site data like page titles and other metadata
- **Ruby** - The underlying programming language that runs Jekyll
- **HTML** - Markup language for content structure and semantics
- **CSS** - Adds styling and design elements
- **GitHub** - Hosts code, enables version control and review workflow
- **GitHub Pages** - Provides free and fast hosting for the Jekyll site
- **Visual Studio Code** - Text editor used for authoring
- **Trello** - Kanban boards for task management
- **Grammarly** - Checks grammar and readability
- **HTMLProofer** - Validates links and HTML output quality
- **Jekyll Sass Converter** - Allows using Sass syntax for CSS
- **Jekyll Attachments** - Adds file attachment capability
- **Jekyll Compress HTML** - Minifies HTML for faster performance

Among others that may be added based on evolving requirements.
