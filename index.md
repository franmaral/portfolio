## Portfolio Project

While **aerospace XML documentation** has been my primary focus area, I've recently expanded into IT writing through self-initiated projects around software systems and web applications. 

I'm passionate about leveraging lightweight markup including **Markdown, HTML, CSS in static pages** to make content reusable, portable and future-ready. 

Through my writing portfolio and client reviews, you'll discover how I simplify the complex without losing technical depth.
