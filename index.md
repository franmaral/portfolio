Fran Martinez. `Technical Writer` 
{: .fs-7 }

Welcome to my portfolio page! I'm a skilled writer and editor with over 16 years helping global firms communicate complex information to customers and users. My analytical approach allows me to quickly grasp new technologies and translate specifications into simplified guides, blogs and training manuals.

## Getting started



## Portfolio Project

While **aerospace XML documentation** has been my primary focus area, I've recently expanded into IT writing through self-initiated projects around software systems and web applications. 

I'm passionate about leveraging lightweight markup including Markdown, HTML, CSS in static pages to make content reusable, portable and future-ready. Through my writing portfolio and client reviews, you'll discover how I simplify the complex without losing technical depth.

## Motivations

The idea behind this portfolio website was the creation of a real-life writing sample that would showcase my **technical documentation skills**. As a technical writer, I used tools that we use every day. These include Markdown for writing, Jekyll for content modelling, and GitHub for version control.  

I wanted to emphasise the **documentation mindset** I brought to the table, rather than approaching this as just another development project. 

I focused on **simplifying complex technical details** into easy to understand language, while carefully organising the information to ensure a seamless user experience. 

From structured writing in Markdown to optimised site architecture, this project reflects an end-to-end technical communication perspective rather than just coding skills.

## Technology

More specifically, here is a list of key technologies I used to create this site:

- **Markdown** - For authoring content using simple text-based syntax
- **Jekyll** - Static site generator that builds the overall website structure
- **YAML** - Stores site data like page titles and other metadata
- **Ruby** - The underlying programming language that runs Jekyll
- **HTML** - Markup language for content structure and semantics
- **CSS** - Adds styling and design elements
- **GitHub** - Hosts code, enables version control and review workflow
- **GitHub Pages** - Provides free and fast hosting for the Jekyll site
- **Visual Studio Code** - Text editor used for authoring
- **Trello** - Kanban boards for task management
- **Grammarly** - Checks grammar and readability
- **HTMLProofer** - Validates links and HTML output quality
- **Jekyll Sass Converter** - Allows using Sass syntax for CSS
- **Jekyll Attachments** - Adds file attachment capability
- **Jekyll Compress HTML** - Minifies HTML for faster performance

Among others that may be added based on evolving requirements.
